Description
	

Technologies

C4AT - Concurrent TCP Chat Server
	

Engineered a scalable, concurrent TCP chat server in Go. It efficiently handles multiple simultaneous client connections using goroutines and channels and features a robust anti-abuse system with rate-limiting and automatic IP banning to ensure high availability and server stability.
	

Go TCP/IP

Maze Runner Game
	

Developed a complete 2D maze game from the ground up. The project features a high-performance enemy AI using Dijkstra's algorithm for intelligent pathfinding and a robust collision detection system that maintains consistent game physics and a smooth 60 FPS frame rate.

💼 Professional Experience

Software Development Intern @ Ascassy Cloud Healthcare (Apr 2024 – Aug 2024)

As an intern, I contributed to improving software reliability and performance by engineering comprehensive unit and integration tests. I operated within an Agile team, using Jira and GitLab for CI/CD, and played an active role in resolving critical bugs, which led to a 25% improvement in QA metrics. My experience there solidified my skills in systematic debugging, cross-functional collaboration, and maintaining high code standards through peer reviews.
🌐 Community & Leadership

Technical Team Member @ Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) (Oct 2023 – May 2024)

I was actively involved in fostering the tech community at my university. My role involved organizing large-scale hackathons for over 100 students and mentoring participants in competitive events like CTFs. I also tutored foundational concepts in linear algebra and probability to help students bridge the gap to machine learning.
